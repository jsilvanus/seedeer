# seedeer

A Node.js vision-model toolkit — the vision counterpart to
[`@jsilvanus/embedeer`](https://github.com/jsilvanus/embedeer) (text
embeddings) and [`@jsilvanus/chattydeer`](https://github.com/jsilvanus/chattydeer)
(LLM chat). Import it directly with no HTTP server in the loop; local or
remote model execution is a configuration detail, not an API difference.

> **Status: Phase 2 complete.** Image embeddings (`JointEmbedder`,
> `VisualEmbedder`) and captioning (`Captioner`) are real and working,
> across all four execution modes (`process`/`thread`/`socket`/`grpc`).
> VQA and detection/tracking are still stubs that throw
> `NotImplementedError` pointing back to the relevant roadmap phase. See
> [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) for what's coming and in what order,
> and [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the design
> principles behind it.

## Planned functionality

| Pillar | What it does | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| Image embeddings ✅ | Joint image-text (CLIP-class) and vision-only (DINOv2-class) embeddings | [docs/features/embeddings.md](docs/features/embeddings.md) |
| Captioning ✅ | Cheap, fast, generic image descriptions | [docs/features/captioning.md](docs/features/captioning.md) |
| Visual Question Answering | Question-driven answers about an image, local or delegated to a remote OpenAI-compatible vision endpoint | [docs/features/vqa.md](docs/features/vqa.md) |
| Detect + Track + Zone-trigger | Real-time person detection, cross-frame tracking, and named-zone enter/exit events for production-assistant use cases | [docs/features/detection-tracking.md](docs/features/detection-tracking.md) |

OCR and image redaction/pixel mutation are explicit non-goals — see
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Design principles (short version)

1. No HTTP in the consuming product — `import` and call a method.
2. Every pillar supports local-or-remote execution (`process` / `thread` /
   `socket` / `grpc`), including the real-time detection/tracking path.
3. Where model strength matters more than latency (VQA), the backend is
   pluggable: a small local model by default, or delegation to a
   configured remote endpoint — the call shape never changes.
4. Reuses embedeer's proven worker-pool/provider-loader/server patterns
   rather than reinventing them for vision inputs.
5. No tight coupling to any specific downstream consumer.

Full rationale in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
